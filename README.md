# SAFRS python REST API Framework

## Overview

SAFRS is an acronym for **S**ql**A**lchemy **F**lask-**R**estful **S**wagger. The purpose of this framework is to help create a self-documenting REST API for the sqlalchemy database objects and relationships. These objects can be serialized to JSON and can be created, retrieved, updated and deleted through the REST API. Class methods can be exposed and invoked using JSON HTTP requests as well. Class and method descriptions and examples can be provided in yaml syntax in the code comments. The description is parsed and shown in the swagger web interface. 

The result is a [json-api](jsonapi.org) and [swagger](https://swagger.io/) compliant API interface.

As a proof-of-concept, I have deployed the [relationship demo](examples/demo_relationship.py) on http://thomaxxl.pythonanywhere.com .

## Installation

The usual:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomaxxl/safrs
cd safrs
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

or to run the example within virtualenv:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomaxxl/safrs
cd safrs
virtualenv safrs
source safrs/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/demo.py [web-ip]
```

## HTTP Methods

The objects can be queried using a REST API. The APIs support following HTTP operations:

- GET : Retrieve an object or a list of object identifiers
- PUT : Create or Update an object. The "Location" header of the response contains the URL of the resource
- DELETE: Delete an object
- POST : Apply a method to an object (e.g. user.send_mail(email) instructs the backend to send an email)

## Objects

Database objects are implemented as subclasses of the SAFRSBase and SQLAlchemy model classes. The SQLAlchemy columns are serialized to JSON when the corresponding REST API is invoked. 

Following example from [demo.py](examples/demo.py) illustrates how the API is built and documented:

```python
class User(SAFRSBase, db.Model):
    '''
        description: User description
    '''
    __tablename__ = 'Users'
    id = Column(String, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, default = '')
    email = Column(String, default = '')

    # Following method is exposed through the REST API 
    # This means it can be invoked with a HTTP POST
    @documented_api_method
    def send_mail(self, email):
        '''
            description : Send an email
            args:
                email:
                    type : string 
                    example : test email
        '''
        content = 'Mail to {} : {}\n'.format(self.name, email)
        return { 'result' : 'sent {}'.format(content)}

```

The User class is implemented as a subclass of 
- db.Model: SQLAlchemy object
- SAFRSBase: Implements JSON serialization for the object and generates (swagger) API documentation

This User object is then exposed through the web interface using the Api object

```python 
api.expose_object(User)
``` 

The User object REST methods are available on /User, the swagger schema is available on /api/swagger.json and the UI is available on /api/:
![User Swagger](docs/images/USER_swagger.png)

## Methods

### Custom Methods

The ```send_mail``` method is documented with the ```documented_api_method``` decorator. 
This function generates a schema based on the function documentation. This documentation contains yaml specification of the API which is used by the swagger UI. 
This method can then be invoked with following HTTP POST Json payload:

![User Swagger](docs/images/POST_swagger.png)

The yaml specification has to be in the first part of the function and class comments. These parts are delimited by four dashes ("----") . The rest of the comment may contain additional documentation.

### Class Methods

Two class-level methods have been defined to facilitate object retrieval:

* **lookup** : retrieve a list of objects that match the argument list. For example, following HTTP POST request to a container will retrieve a list of itemswhere the name is "thomas"
```json
{
  "method": "lookup",
  "args": {
    "name": "thomas"
  }
}
```

* **get_list** : retrieve a list of the items with the specified ID's


## Relationships

Database object such as the User class from the demo.py example can be extended to include relationships with other objects. The demo_relationship.py contains following extension of the User class where a relationship with the Book class is implemented:

```python
class User(SAFRSBase, db.Model):
    '''
        description: User description
    '''
    __tablename__ = 'Users'
    id = Column(String, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, default = '')
    email = Column(String, default = '')
    books = db.relationship('Book', back_populates = "user")
...
``` 

A many-to-one database association is declared by the back_populates relationship argument.
The Book class is simply another subclass of SAFRSBase and db.Model, similar to the previous User class:

```python
class Book(SAFRSBase, db.Model):
    '''
        description: Book description
    '''
    __tablename__ = 'Books'
    id = Column(String, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, default = '')
    user_id = Column(String, ForeignKey('Users.id'))
    user = db.relationship('User', back_populates='books')
```

The User.book relationship can be queried in the API through the following endpoints:
![Relations Swagger](docs/images/Relations_swagger.png)

- POST adds an item to the relationship
- DELETE removes an item from the relationship
- GET retrieves a list of item ids

The relationship REST API works similarly for one-to-many relationships. 

## Endpoint Naming
As can be seen in the swagger UI:
- the endpoint collection names are the SQLAlchemy \_\_tablename\_\_ properties (e.g. /Users )
- the parameter names are derived from the SAFRSBase class names (e.g. {UserId} )
- the the relationship names are the SAFRSBase class relationship names (e.g /books )

## HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are used to signal success or failure of a REST operation: 
- 200 : OK 
- 201 : The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.
- 204 : No Content, DELETE operation was successful
- 400 : The services raised an exception, for example in case of invalid input
- 500 : Internal Server Error

In case of errors( status codes 400+ ), the log file contains a stacktrace. 
Two custom exceptions are defined in errors.py: ValidationError and GenericError. 
In case of errors, the webservice will return a default HTTP status code 500 and a customizable error message, for example

```
{
  "error": "Failed to execute query Entity '<class 'C2_server.Image'>' has no property 'namex'"
}
```

## More Examples and Use Cases
The [examples](examples) folder contains more example scripts:
- Exposing an exisitng sqlite database as a REST service
- Using a sha hash as primary key (id)

## Limitations & TODOs

This code was developed for a specific use-case and may not be flexible enough for everyone's needs. 

- Composite keys might not work well.
- The use of \_\_builtin\_\_ for the global variables log, db and app is a bit of a dirty hack (I'll try to work around that but it's harder than it seems)
- Not all of the documentation available in swagger1 is shown with swagger2

## Thanks

I developed this code when I worked at [Excellium Services](https://www.excellium-services.com/). They allowed me to open source it when I stopped working there.
